Python - Test-driven development
---------------------------------

The doctest module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown. It is more suitable for  documentation  since we can insert it in the codeâ€™s docstrings.

Unittest allows us to test our code in an object-oriented approach
It supports many features such as test automation, setup, and code test teardown
